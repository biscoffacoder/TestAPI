# TestAPI
This is a Test application created using SpringBoot, supports fetching information from typicode/API to get payload and works with Users/Posts logic to provide desired output. The aim is to have a quick refresher on basics of calling an API, storing it to Repository, custom methods in Repository, using Optional class, Swagger documentation and Lombok dependency.
